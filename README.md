## Minute Cards

Before each break, have learners take a minute to write one positive
thing about the most recent session on the green sticky note (e.g.,
one thing they've learned that they think will be useful), and one
thing they found too fast, too slow, confusing, or irrelevant on the
red one. While they are enjoying their coffee or lunch, instructors
can review and cluster these to find patterns. It only takes a few
minutes to see what learners are enjoying, what they still find
confusing, what problems they're having, and what questions are still
unanswered.
