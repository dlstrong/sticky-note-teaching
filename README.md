## Distributing Attention

Sticky notes can be used to ensure that the instructor's attention is
fairly distributed.  Have each learner write their name on a sticky
note and put it on their laptop.  Each time the instructor calls on
them or answers one of their questions, their sticky note comes down.
Once all the sticky notes are down, everyone puts theirs up again.

This technique makes it easy for the instructor to see who they
haven't spoken with recently, which in turn helps them avoid the
unconscious trap of only interacting with the most extroverted of
their learners.  It also shows learners that attention is being
distributed fairly, so that when they are called on, they won't feel
like they're being singled out.
