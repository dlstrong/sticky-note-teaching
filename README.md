## Peer Instruction

Learners can use sticky notes of different colors to signal their
answers to multiple-choice questions when peer instruction is being
used:

1.  The instructor give a brief introduction to the topic, then
    presents learners with a multiple-choice question (MCQ) designed
    to probe their misconceptions.

2.  The learners vote on their answers to the MCQ by raising a sticky
    note of the appropriate color.  (Alternatively, sticky notes of
    one color can be marked with large symbols, such as letters or
    numbers.)
    *   If the students all have the right answer, move on.
    *   If they all have the same wrong answer, address that specific
        misconception.
    *   If they have a mix of right and wrong answers, give them
        several minutes to discuss those answers with one another in
        small groups (typically 2-4 students) and then reconvene and
        vote again.

Group discussion significantly improves learners' understanding
because it forces them to externalize their thinking, which can be
enough to call out gaps in reasoning. Re-polling the class then lets
the instructor know if they can move on, or if further explanation is
necessary.
