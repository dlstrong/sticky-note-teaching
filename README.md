## Status Flags

Give each learner two sticky notes of different colours, e.g., red and
green. If someone has completed an exercise and wants it checked, they
put the green sticky note on their laptop; if they run into a problem
and need help, the put up the red one. This is better than having
people raise their hands because:

*   it's more discreet (which means they're more likely to actually do
    it),

*   they can keep working while their flag is raised, and

*   the instructor can quickly see from the front of the room what state
    the class is in.

## Promissory Notes

Whenever a learner asks a question that the instructor doesn't know
how to answer, or doesn't want to answer right away because it would
derail the lesson, the instructor should make themselves a quick note
and put it on the wall near them.  When the learners are working on an
exercise or taking a break, the instructor can choose one or more of
these promissory notes and figure out what to say or how to say it.
This helps the instructor keep track of questions that might otherwise
be forgotten, and signals to learners that their questions will
actually be answered.  (It also gives the instructor an opening to
decide which questions to answer and in how much detail.)

## Fair Air Time

Some people are so used to the sound of their own voice that they will
insist on talking half the time no matter how many other people are in
the room. One way to combat this is to give everyone three sticky
notes at the start of the meeting.  Every time they speak, they have
to take down one sticky note.  When they're out of notes, they aren't
allowed to speak until everyone has used at least one, at which point
everyone gets all of their sticky notes back.  This ensures that
nobody talks more than three times as often as the quietest person in
the meeting, and completely changes the dynamics of most groups:
people who have given up trying to be heard because they always get
trampled suddenly have space to contribute, and the overly-frequent
speakers quickly realize just how unfair they have been.
