## Promissory Notes

Whenever a learner asks a question that the instructor doesn't know
how to answer, or doesn't want to answer right away because it would
derail the lesson, the instructor should make themselves a quick note
and put it on the wall near them.  When the learners are working on an
exercise or taking a break, the instructor can choose one or more of
these promissory notes and figure out what to say or how to say it.
This helps the instructor keep track of questions that might otherwise
be forgotten, and signals to learners that their questions will
actually be answered.  (It also gives the instructor an opening to
decide which questions to answer and in how much detail.)
