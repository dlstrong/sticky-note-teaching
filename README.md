## Status Flags

Give each learner two sticky notes of different colours, e.g., red and
green. If someone has completed an exercise and wants it checked, they
put the green sticky note on their laptop; if they run into a problem
and need help, the put up the red one. This is better than having
people raise their hands because:

*   it's more discreet (which means they're more likely to actually do
    it),

*   they can keep working while their flag is raised, and

*   the instructor can quickly see from the front of the room what state
    the class is in.
